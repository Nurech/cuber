##Cuber robot files
.Ims files are David's original files for the MindCuber-RI (see readme.txt)

.py files are slightly edited versions of those same and are meant to be uploaded to the robot as well. The modified 
files allow communication between robot and server - most notably for sending scanning results and receiving solution.
